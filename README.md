The goal of this application is to develop a software widget to QC and data edits of set and catch and biological data received from fisheries observers aboard commercial vessels. This data is collected and supplied to DFO under contract by several different service providers. The application of the developed widget can be used to convert the raw ASCII files (flat file) data received from different observer companies into human readable CSV format and import it to a database storage to perform advanced various data quality and validation checks. The development of this widget is using Python as a programming language with extended libraries and SQLite3 for backend database operation.
How to compile/execute the code: Compile - DFO_NL_ASOP_DB&QC_Main.py File. This file will generate all the necessary DB in the backend.
